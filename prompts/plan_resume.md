## Instructions

A previous run was interrupted before completing all stages. Review the summary above and the current state of the codebase:

1. Use Glob and Read to examine the files that were modified in the previous run.
2. Assess what work is already done and still valid.
3. Identify what remains to be done to complete the ticket.
4. Skip re-doing work that is already complete and correct.
5. Produce a plan that continues from where the previous run left off.

Focus your plan on the remaining work. If tests were already written, note which ones pass and which fail. If implementation was partially done, describe what's left to implement.
