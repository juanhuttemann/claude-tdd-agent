The test results above are AUTHORITATIVE — they come from an independent test run by the pipeline, not from any previous agent output. If exit code is NOT 0, tests are FAILING and you MUST issue VERDICT: CHANGES_NEEDED regardless of any other consideration.

Read every file that was created or modified — both tests and implementation. Check for correctness, missing edge cases, conventions, security, and code quality. End your review with exactly one of:
  VERDICT: APPROVED
  VERDICT: CHANGES_NEEDED
If CHANGES_NEEDED, list the specific issues that must be fixed.
