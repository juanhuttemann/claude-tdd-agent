You are stage 2 of an automated TDD pipeline. Execute the RED phase: write failing tests exactly as specified in the plan below.

## Implementation Plan

{plan}

---

Write the test file(s) specified above. After writing each test, run `{test_cmd}` and verify it FAILS. If a test passes (it shouldn't yet) or errors for the wrong reason, fix and re-run. Keep iterating until all new tests fail for the correct reason (the feature/fix is missing).

Do NOT implement the feature yet. Do NOT modify existing passing tests. Report the test file paths and the failure messages.
