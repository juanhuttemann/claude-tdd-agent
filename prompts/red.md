Now execute the RED phase of TDD.

Based on the plan above, write the test file(s). After writing each test, run it with `{test_cmd}` and verify it FAILS. If a test passes (it shouldn't yet) or errors for the wrong reason, fix and re-run. Keep iterating until all new tests fail for the correct reason (the feature/fix is missing). Report the test file paths and the failure messages.
