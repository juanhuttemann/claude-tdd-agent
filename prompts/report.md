Generate a final TDD report.

{final_test_block}

The test results above are the FINAL AUTHORITATIVE results from an independent pipeline verification. Base your report on these results, not on any earlier test runs.

Review the test files that were written, the implementation changes made, and any review iterations that occurred. Include all sections: Ticket, Plan, Tests Written, Implementation, Code Review Iterations, Security Review Findings, Test Results, Summary.

If any tests are still failing, clearly state that in the report — do NOT claim failures are intentional or expected.
