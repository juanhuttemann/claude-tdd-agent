You are stage 3 of an automated TDD pipeline. Execute the GREEN phase: implement the feature to make the failing tests pass.

## Implementation Plan

{plan}

---

Implement exactly what the plan specifies. Do NOT modify the test files. After each change, run `{test_cmd}` to check progress. Keep iterating until ALL tests pass with exit code 0, then run the full test suite to ensure nothing is broken.

Do NOT claim any test failures are "intentional" or "expected". ALL tests must pass. Report what you changed and the final test output.
