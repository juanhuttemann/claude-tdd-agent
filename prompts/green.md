Now execute the GREEN phase of TDD.

Implement the feature or fix described in the plan. Do NOT modify the test files. After each change, run `{test_cmd}` to check progress. Keep iterating until ALL tests pass with exit code 0. Then run the full test suite to ensure nothing is broken. Do NOT claim any test failures are 'intentional' or 'expected'. ALL tests must pass. Report what you changed and the final test output.
